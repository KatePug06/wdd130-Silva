        COME AND SEE WHERE YOUR FOOD COMES FROM: Situated on 700 acres on the north side of Gooding, ID, the Pocket Ranch & Creamery has been selling local dairy products to residents of southern Idaho since the 1970s. Although there are lots of interesting things to see at our local ranch, our dairy cows are the main attraction - their milk is used to make everything from cheese, cream and ice cream. Once you've met the herd, you'll have a chance to purchase dairy products made with milk from these cows. Talk about a memorable learning experience!
      </p>
      <p>
        THE POCKET RANCH AND CREAMERY IS A THIRD-GENERATION FAMILY FARM. It features:
A distribution point that is centered around convenience, where you can pick up your farm fresh products and your favorite cracked before hitting the road or heading home. 
An ice cream parlor, where the whole family can enjoy a treat!
      </p>
      <p>
      THIS FARM IS OUR LEGACY: Joe Bingham grew up watching his father and grandfather work hard to raise cattle and provide for their family. Inspired by their work ethic, Joey took over the family business in 2012. Joe is now raising his kids to take care of the crops and livestock - including chickens, which his son Brogan insisted on adding to the ranch. We'd be glad to take you on a tour and show you a typical day on our farm in Gooding, ID. The family of 6 work together to keep the farm and creamery running. All of this doesn’t happen by itself… The family, Joe, Jen, Brynlee, Tyson, Jaxon and Brogan make it happen. It is so amazing and such a fun way to grow up.

      <h3>CREAMERY PROCESS</h3>
      <p>
        Here at Pocket Ranch and Creamery, we strive to make it possible for all to be able to taste the delicious flavored milk we provide. We love to put a unique and fun spin on milk. Let's start at our roots, where our products come from. It all starts in the dirt on a 700 acre farm on the north side of a small farm town in Gooding, Idaho. Each Spring planting season starts and the Binghams are out there with the disk, harrow and planters. Through the Spring and into the Summer you get to watch the produce grow in order to feed the cows at the dairy. Although milk is our end product, it all started in the dirt. As crops are grown, harvested and fed to cows, miracles happen. Miraculously forage is converted to delicious milk that gets distributed and enjoyed to hundreds of households.Our cows are cared for daily with a huge amount of attention and care. From the fields to the milking parlor, we are able to get fresh creamy milk from all of our cows. After the milking process, the milk is brought into the creamery to be pasteurized, mixed and bottled so that everyone can taste the deliciousness. After the milk is brought into the creamery it is heated up and cooled down through a process called pasteurization. This process kills any harmful bacteria that can be found in the milk. It is then pumped into another holding vat where it will be connect4ed and brought to the bottler. The milk is then pumped into clean sterile bottles and capped so that it can be sold and shared with everyone. After being bottled, the milk is placed into crates and transported to a refrigerated trailer. It is then brought into the station, the Pocket Sinclaire to be sold. Anyone and everyone can come and taste this healthy goodness. This is how our farm fresh milk is transformed from a blade of grass to the delicious milk found in our station for all to enjoy.
